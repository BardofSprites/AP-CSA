# AP-CSA
The master repository for my AP Computer Science A projects. 

## Bedroom Project
The `Bedroom` folder has all of the files for the bedroom project.

## Hangman Project
The `Hangman` folder has all of the files for the hangman project. I'm thinking of rewriting it to be more *object oriented*. 

# Exercises
This folder is full of execises that I work on during class.
