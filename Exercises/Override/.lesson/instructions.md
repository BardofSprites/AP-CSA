# Overriding  

  **There are many different types of companies out there so trying to make one class that fits them all would be a challenge. We are going to take a look at modeling out a general company with the Company class and then customize that class with the OnlineCompany subclass.**

  ## Instructions
  The basic structure is set up for both of these classes. Your task is to complete these classes as specified in the comments of each class.

  ### Company Class
  1. Complete the two constructors
  2. Complete ```getName()```, ```getAddress()``` and  ```toString()```

### OnlineCompany Class
1. Complete the constructor
2. Complete ```address()``` and ```toString()```

### Main
1. Once complete, use the mainr class to create a **Company** and **OnlineCompany** object
2. Print each out using the ```toString()```.
